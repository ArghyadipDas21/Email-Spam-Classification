# Email Spam Classification

This project is a machine learning model that classifies emails as spam or not using various natural language processing techniques. The model is implemented in Python and uses the `sklearn` library for training and evaluating the model.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization.
- Training using a Naive Bayes classifier.
- Real-time prediction using Streamlit.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the StreamLit application
   ```
   streamlit run spamDetector.py
